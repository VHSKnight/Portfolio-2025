This is a collection of work I have done over my course with Generation Bootcamp. One of the UK's leading tech bootcamp providers, awarded outstanding by Ofsted. It contains an app created with Python and bash to deplay a LAMP stack for Word Press in Linux. I also mean to add some snap shots of the MySQL database I created to sync with my app dictionaries content.
